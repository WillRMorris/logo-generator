  ## Description
    I created this project to easily generate simple logos using svg. 
    using this function you can create  a simple logo with only a 
    couple small lines of input. This was my first time touching 
    svg formatting so it was interesting to see how that worked in js.

  ## Installation
    to install, simply clone the repo and run it in the command line.

  ## Usage
    simply follow the prompts in the commandline and the system 
    does the rest! hexidecimals or generic names are used for 
    colors, and a generic lowercase system of input with no 
    additional spaces or characters is required.

  ## How to Contribute

    contribution from others.
